# Karels to the Max

This problem, inspired by the Subdivision problem from the Winter 2012 midterm and [Koalas to the Max](http://www.koalastothemax.com/), draws a giant circle on the screen, and as you continue to move your mouse over it, it resolves into an image.

This is intended to be a review of basic graphics and MouseEvents, and the first substantial use of multidimensional arrays and using color values. I've run this demo two or three times during the section after the lecture about how images can be represented as multidimensional arrays.
