# QuietTalk

This problem is a recreation of the website [quietalk](http://quietalk.com/) for silent messaging to the person next to you. It builds off of the section problem "[Drawing centered text](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/handouts/110%20Section%20Handout%202.pdf)" frequently given out in week 3 of the quarter. 

This is intended as a very brief review of interactors. As of January 21, 2014, I haven't tried demoing it in section, but I would expect to run it around week 8 in the place of a simple interactors demo from section handout 7.
